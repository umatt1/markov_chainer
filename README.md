# markov_chainer
This project is the result of me adding a gui to an in-class exercise of bioinf 529
It allows users to input a series of texts (or select one of two examples) into a markov chain, which then builds a model and predicts a new text

It's pretty self-explanatory to use, just input "python3 main.exe" on the command line and the gui should pop up.
You will need:
1. numpy
2. PySimpleGUI
3. clipboard
